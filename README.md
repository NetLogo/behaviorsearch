BehaviorSearch
==============

BehaviorSearch is a software tool to help with automating the exploration of agent-based models (ABMs), by using genetic algorithms and other heuristic techniques to search the parameter-space.  
BehaviorSearch interfaces with the popular NetLogo ABM development platform, to provide a low-threshold way to search for combinations of model parameter settings that will result in a specified target behavior.

INSTALLATION:
=============

On Mac/Linux:  Copy the contents of the zip archive into the "NetLogo" application folder.  Everthing should end up in the "behaviorsearch" subfolder, within the NetLogo folder.

On Windows:  Run the installer, and choose to install BehaviorSearch into a subfolder of the NetLogo folder.  Otherwise you'll need to uninstall it and try again.
