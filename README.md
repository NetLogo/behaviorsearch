BehaviorSearch
==============

BehaviorSearch is a software tool to help with automating the exploration of agent-based models (ABMs), by using genetic algorithms and other heuristic techniques to search the parameter-space.  
BehaviorSearch interfaces with the popular NetLogo ABM development platform, to provide a low-threshold way to search for combinations of model parameter settings that will result in a specified target behavior.

INSTALLATION:
=============

BehaviorSearch is now bundled with NetLogo 6, so no installation necessary.

RUNNING:
=============

Windows:  Run the shortcut on the Desktop, or Start Menu->NetLogo->BehaviorSearch
Mac: Run the "behaviorsearch_gui.command" script in the "behaviorsearch" folder.
Linux: Run the "behaviorsearch_gui.sh" script in the "behaviorsearch" folder.

If you want to run behaviorsearch headlessly, you probably need to set the JAVA_HOME environment variable in your shell. 
Then run the behaviorsearch_headless script in the "behaviorsearch" directory. 
In Windows and Linux, the behaviorsearch directory is located inside the "app" folder within the NetLogo installation.

Windows:  Run "app\behaviorsearch\behaviorsearch_headless.bat" (located in the NetLogo installation folder).
Mac: Run "behaviorsearch/behaviorsearch_gui.command" (located in the NetLogo installation folder).
Linux: Run "app/behaviorsearch/behaviorsearch_gui.sh" (located in the NetLogo installation folder).
