NEW for Version 1.00: 
 * Updated for NetLogo 5.x  
   (Kudos to Kevin Zollman for submitting a patch that helped with this transition.)
 * Fixed issue with range of possible initial seeds for the random number generator.
   (This was fixed in NetLogo here: https://github.com/NetLogo/NetLogo/issues/111 )  
 * Search protocols (.bsearch files) created with earlier versions of BehaviorSearch
   should still load/work in this version, although the change in how random seeds
   are handled means that results from doing the same search with the same random 
   seed may differ slightly from the results from previous versions.

 - KNOWN ISSUES for Version 1.00:
   * Due to a change (regression?) in how NetLogo 5's controlling API handles 
     runtime errors, these errors may not always be properly reported by BehaviorSearch.
     I am looking into it, but the fix for this may have to wait for a future NetLogo release.
     In the meantime, as long as you carefully debug your model beforehand to make sure that it 
     won't pop up any errors while running, this shouldn't be an issue.
